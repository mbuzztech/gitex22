%% Default mode is landscape, which is what we want, however dvips and
%% a0poster do not quite do the right thing, so we end up with text in
%% landscape style (wide and short) down a portrait page (narrow and
%% long). Printing this onto the a0 printer chops the right hand edge.
%% However, 'psnup' can save the day, reorienting the text so that the
%% poster prints lengthways down an a0 portrait bounding box.

%% $ dvips -Ppdf -G0 -o poster.ps poster.dvi
%%
%% The dvips options are:
%% Ppdf: use the PDF printer configuration file
%% G0  : shift lower characters to higher position 
%%       (splits ligatures when using Times-Roman font)

%% g:  take size from Postscript file
%% p:  include all fonts as partial fonts
%% i:  include all non-standard fonts
%% t:  map graphics transfer functions from PostScript to PDF. 
%% C:  use RGB color map
%% w:  width in points (1/72 inch) for 1188 mm
%% h:  height in points (1/72 inch) for 839 mm
%% Q:  take embedded fonts from PSFonts directory, not Postscript file
%% Note also that the -w and -h options need to be included else
%% some of the Postscript figures may not be displayed (particularly

%% Also, the newest version of pstill (1.55.91) does not deal well with

%% The basic format of the poster is to create text boxes with the

%% with how to lay thing out.  In the old version of this template,
%% the content was always provided with alternatives suitable for
%% printing on sheets of paper (resizing fonts, images, etc).  I
%% think that's too confusing to read.  The old layout was:
%%     \ifposter
%%          some poster commands go here

%%          an alternative style here in case you are printing on

\CHead{Pre-trained models}
Get Results Sooner by using Pre-trained models, scripts, and more translate to better results sooner over do-it - yourself problem solving.Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT. Recently, use of Pre-trained models have been   achieving great success and become an attractive milestone in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for Enterprise Business owners. Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge model parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from massive labeled and unlabeled data.    By storing knowledge into huge parameters and fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in huge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been extensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis. It is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for downstream tasks rather than develop  learning models from scratch.
